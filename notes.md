## Thinking in react (Architecture)
- [ ] Break the UI into a component hierarchy ===> Single responsibility
- [ ] Build a static version: Less thinking much typing (coz no interactivity - more thinking)
- [ ] Identify the minimal representation of UI state
- [ ] Identify where your state should live
- [ ] Add inverse data flow

## React patterns
- [ ] Reducer pattern
- [ ] Context API

## Method + Hooks
[ ] React.memo --> receives fn component && rerender based on prop change
[ ] useCallback ---> give back a memoized fn based on deps.
[ ] useMemo ----> call fn depending on deps. 
[ ] useReducer ----> Almost like redux in some way

## Reducer pattern
[ ] useReducer
[ ] React.memo
[ ] useCallback

## Context API
[ ] Reducer pattern


```
<ParentComponent>
    <ChildAComponent name={name}>
        <Component name={name} />
    </ChildAComponent>
</ParentComponent>>
```
